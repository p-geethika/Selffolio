						I am P. Geethika Naidu, a dedicated and driven Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. Currently in my third year, I maintain a stellar academic record with a CGPA of 9.05 through the sixth semester. My passion lies at the intersection of web development and machine learning. I find joy in the intricate process of designing, developing, and implementing software programs that enhance organizational efficiency. My commitment to continuous learning has fueled my enthusiasm for exploring emerging technologies.
						As a smart worker and quick learner, I am adept at adapting to new skills and challenges. I have honed my programming and coding abilities through various competitions, contests, and hackathons, showcasing my commitment to excellence. I am proud to have been an MLH Fellow for the Global Hack Week in both October 2022 and January 2024 cohorts.In addition to my academic pursuits, I have mentored over 100 students at my college through the Cognizance Club, demonstrating strong leadership and communication skills. I actively engage in open-source initiatives, participating in programs like Hacktoberfest'22, Smart Digital Hackathon'22, Hackfest 2k23, Tata Imagination Challenge. Furthermore, I have practical experience as a virtual AI intern at Accenture and as a Campus Ambassador Intern at Techkriti, IIT Kanpur.
						My journey also includes contributing to the global tech community through various platforms, such as open-source programs and hackathons. I am driven by the belief that challenges are opportunities for growth, and I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences in future endeavors. I am enthusiastic about the design, development, and implementation of software programs for organizational effectiveness. I am looking for challenging opportunities to upskill my programming and coding abilities in emerging technologies. I am a patient person with excellent communication skills. I am very adaptable when it comes to learning new skills. I am a smart worker and a quick learner, so I can easily shape myself into the desired shape. I am also an MLH Fellow for the Global Hack Week of October 2022 and January 2024 cohort. Aside from that, I enjoy competing in different competitions/contests/Hackathons. I've mentored a group of over 100 students at my college through Cognizance Club. In addition, I've participated in open-source programs like Hacktoberfest'22, Smart Digital Hackathon'22, Hackfest 2k23, Tata Imagination Challenge, and have experience being a virtual AI intern at Accenture and a Campus Ambassador Intern at Techkriti, IIT Kanpur.

					<p>Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. Quantum algorithms take a new approach to these sorts of complex problems - creating multidimensional spaces where the patterns linking individual data points emerge. But what is Quantum Computing? Why do we need it?</p>
